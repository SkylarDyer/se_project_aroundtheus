**Intro**
  
This project was designed to better practice the grid system while further understanding advanced HTML and CSS concepts such as media queries that alter the project's size based on different screen sizes.


**Figma**

For Around The U.S., I sourced all images and vector designs from the Figma page, which included image sizing, fonts, margin widths, and detailed how the finished project should look.

**GitHub**

**JavaScript**
During this project, advanced javascript such as introducing class methods and asynchronous programming functions were implemented throughout all aspects of the website in order to add smooth and consistent responses between user interactions and site functionality.

**API**
In order for this project to work, I learned how to connect the user info and data to an API so that the information may be stored securely and only accessed when called upon by edits.
